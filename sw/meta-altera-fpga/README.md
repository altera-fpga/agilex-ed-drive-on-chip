## Dependencies

### Kas
[kas](https://github.com/siemens/kas) is recommended to configure a build.

`kas` is a Python based tool and can be installed using `pip` directly or in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container which avoids the need to also install required [Yocto build dependencies](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/2.2.2/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#required-packages-for-the-host-development-system).

We recommend using `kas` in a Docker container. If you don't currently have Docker installed follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) before running the below commands to pull down the `kas` helper script:

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/siemens/kas/raw/refs/heads/master/kas-container -O /usr/bin/kas
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/kas
```

[Read the official documentation](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) for more information.


## Building A Minimal Image
To build a minimal SD card image for a given target run the following commands:

```bash
KAS_MACHINE=${MACHINE} kas build kas-example.yml
```

For example:

```bash
KAS_MACHINE=agilex5_mk_a5e065bb32aes1 kas build kas-example.yml
```

See above for a list of supported `MACHINE` identifiers.

Once the build has finished successfully you will have a `.wic.gz` image available in `build/tmp/deploy/images/${MACHINE}` which can be [written to an SD card](docs/flash_sd_card.md).

## Building A Custom Image
To build your own custom image it is recommended to create a `kas` configuration file for your project. You can use [kas-example.yml](../kas-example.yml) provided in this repository as a starting point.
For more advanced projects you may also want to [create a dedicated Yocto layer](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev/dev-manual/layers.html) for your project.

### Setting Up Your Project

The `kas` configuration YAML file is where you will add all of your project specfic configuration to customize your image. The most common configuration options are outlined in the following sections.

See [kas documentation](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/project-configuration.html) for more information.

### Updating Project Name
You can rename `kas-example.yml` to reflect the name of your project. For example `kas-${my_project_name}.yml`

Open your projects kas config file in your preferred text editor and update the `example_project` identifier in the `local_conf_header` section to reflect your project name.

## Configuration
The `altera-fpga` layers are designed to be modular and configurable enabling you to build a bespoke image for your project easily and without additional bloat. The most common configuration options are outlined in the following sections.

### Layers
The `altera-bsp` and `altera-core` layers should always be present in your configuration. The `altera-bsp` layer provides the foundational components to build an image for an Altera SoC FPGA board.

```
repos:
  meta-altera-fpga:
    path: .
    layers:
      meta-altera-bsp:
      meta-altera-core:
```

If you intend to build an image for an Altera Soc FPGA Devkit or third-party vendor board you will also need to add the `altera-devkit` or `altera-vendor` layer to your configuration.

```
repos:
  meta-altera-fpga:
    path: .
    layers:
      meta-altera-devkit:
      meta-altera-vendor:
```

### Required Configuration
The `base` config provided by [kas/base.yml](kas/base.yml) is required and should always be present in you project config `includes` section. This configuration file adds essential BSP related packages and other build environment parameters.

```
  includes:
    - repo: meta-altera-fpga
      file: kas/base.yml
```

You will also need to choose your base distro. [Poky](https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky) is a common reference distro and can be enabled by including [kas/poky.yml](kas/poky.yml).

```
  includes:
    - repo: meta-altera-fpga
      file: kas/poky.yml
```

### Target Machine
To configure your target machine add the following to your projects kas config file substituting `${MACHINE}` with one of the supported machine identifiers listed above:

```
machine: ${MACHINE}
```

For example to build for Agilex 5 E-Series Modular Devkit:

```
machine: agilex5_mk_a5e065bb32aes1
```

> You can omit `machine` from your config file and simply use `KAS_MACHINE=${MACHINE}` when running `kas` commands if preferred

### SoC FPGA Features
Optional build features can be enabled using the `SOCFPGA_FEATURES` variable in your build config. The list of supported features can be found below.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| bitstream | If enabled the `fpga-bitstream` recipe will be built and is expected to populate a core bitstream in the `boot` partition to be programmed on boot. The FPGA core bitstream `.rbf` file should be provided in your own layer using a `fpga-bitstream.bbappend` file or in your build config by setting `FPGA_BST_SRC_URI` and `FPGA_BST_SHA256SUM` as applicable. |
| jffs2 | Enable JFFS2 (Journaling Flash File System version 2) file system support commonly used for NAND flash devices. |
| gpio_sys | Enable sysfs GPIO support in the Linux kernel. |
| usb_adapter | Enable Linux kernel support for common USB peripherals including network adapters and mass storage devices. |
| uio | Enable Userspace I/O support in the Linux kernel. |

An example of enabling `bitstream` and `uio` features in your build config:
```
SOCFPGA_FEATURES:append = " bitstream uio"
```

### Optional Configuration
Some optional `kas` configurations are provided which can be included in your project config to add additional functionality to your image.

The current optional configs are detailed below.

#### Dev
The `Dev` configuration provides some essential tools for a developer focussed image including SSH access out-of-the-box and tools such as `git` and `devmem2` for probing memory addresses.

```
  includes:
    - repo: meta-altera-fpga
      file: kas/dev.yml
```

#### Docker
The `Docker` configuration adds full [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) support to an image including the [containerd](https://containerd.io/) runtime and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) plugin.

```
  includes:
    - repo: meta-altera-fpga
      file: kas/docker.yml
```

### Boot Arguments
If you wish to add additional boot arguments you can append the `IMAGE_BOOT_ARGS` variable. For example to enable the `generic-uio` kernel module on boot:

```
IMAGE_BOOT_ARGS:append = " uio_pdrv_genirq.of_id=generic-uio"
```

## Supported Image Types

 - `mmc` (SD Card)
